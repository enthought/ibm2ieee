This is a bugfix release, addressing distribution and development
issues along with minor cleanups to the core.

- Require NumPy >= 1.14.5 at runtime; build against NumPy == 1.14.5
  at installation time. (PR #8)
- Replace the ``packaging`` dependency of the test suite with
  ``setuptools``; add explicit dependency of the test suite on ``six``.
  (PR #11)
- Add classifiers for Python 3.7 and 3.8, and add Python 3.7 and 3.8
  to the test matrix for Travis and Appveyor. (PR #8)
- Silence some current and future compiler and linter warnings in
  the core C code. (PR #15)

Release 1.0.1
-------------

Release date: 2018-12-04

Bugfix release, fixing another distribution issue.

- Add ``pyproject.toml`` file encapsulating build requirements. With this, a
  ``pip install ibm2ieee`` should automatically download NumPy before
  running the setup script. (PR #7)


Release 1.0.0
-------------

Release date: 2018-12-04

First real release. Fixes some distribution issues with the 0.1.0 release. Code is
otherwise unchanged.

- Fix misuse of ``unicode_literals`` in the setup.py file.

  to render properly on PyPI.
- Boldly bump the version number to 1.0.0, and the Development Status classifier
  to Production/Stable.


Release 0.1.0

Release date: 2018-12-04

Initial release uploaded to PyPI.
