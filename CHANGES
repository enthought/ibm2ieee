-------------

Release date: 2020-02-09

This is a bugfix release, addressing distribution and development
issues along with minor cleanups to the core.

- Require NumPy >= 1.14.5 at runtime; build against NumPy == 1.14.5
  at installation time. (PR #8)
- Replace the ``packaging`` dependency of the test suite with
  ``setuptools``; add explicit dependency of the test suite on ``six``.
  (PR #11)

  to Production/Stable.
