Changelog for ibm2ieee
======================

Release 1.0.2
-------------

Release date: 2020-02-09

This is a bugfix release, addressing distribution and development
issues along with minor cleanups to the core.

- Require NumPy >= 1.14.5 at runtime; build against NumPy == 1.14.5
  at installation time. (PR #8)
- Replace the ``packaging`` dependency of the test suite with
  ``setuptools``; add explicit dependency of the test suite on ``six``.
  (PR #11)
- Add classifiers for Python 3.7 and 3.8, and add Python 3.7 and 3.8
  to the test matrix for Travis and Appveyor. (PR #8)
- Silence some current and future compiler and linter warnings in
  the core C code. (PR #15)
- Apply a micro-optimization for the 64-bit IBM to 32-bit IEEE conversion,
  replacing a 64-bit addition with a 32-bit addition. (PR #15)


Release 1.0.1
-------------

Release date: 2018-12-04

First real release. Fixes some distribution issues with the 0.1.0 release. Code is

  to Production/Stable.
